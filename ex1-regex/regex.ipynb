    "## Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This assignment is adapted from Chris Manning and Dan Jurafsky's Coursera NLP 2012 course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment your task will be to help a poor Masters student at Stanford (yes, basically the definition of oxymoron) who is trying to find someone who would write a [recommendation letter](https://www.uwb.edu/careers/faculty-and-staff/referenceletters/reference-letter-template) to be attached to their graduate school application. This Masters student of ours decided to adopt a cold calling/maining approach: their plan is to reach out to whoever's email/phone they can get their hands on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with knowledge of regular expressions, your task is to help them find as many email addresses and phone numbers as you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task definition\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, given a string\n",

    "your solution should return\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jurafsky@stanford.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It will not always be this easy though, as your solution should also deal with more complex attempts at obfuscation of email addresses, such as\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jurafsky(at)cs.stanford.edu\n",
    "\n",
    "jurafsky at csli dot stanford dot edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "<script type=\"text/javascript\">obfuscate('stanford.edu','jurafsky')</script>\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "jurafsky@stanford.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(No, executing JavaScript is not required in this assignment).\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of phone numbers the same idea applies -- all of the following examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "TEL +1-650-723-0293\n",
    "Phone: (650) 723-0293\n",
    "Tel (+1): 650-723-0293\n",
    "<a href=\"contact.html\">TEL</a> +1&thinsp;650&thinsp;723&thinsp;0293\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "should return the same canonical form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "650-723-0293\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(You can assume all mentioned numbers as well as the Master student will be located in North America, so the international prefix is not required).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: you do not have to deal with any \"next-level\" obfuscation which would require outside information, such as images or strings like the following:*\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"first name\"@cs.stanford.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for you to test your regular expressions and related code we prepared a dataset (its proper name would probably be the *development test set*) which you can find in the `data/dev/` directory. It contains various homepages of Stanford faculty, out of which the emails and phone numbers should be extracted. The file `data/devGOLD` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest you deal with the task of this assignment in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Edit the `process_file` function in the cell below and execute it (hit Ctrl+Enter or Cmd+Enter).\n",
    "2. Your solution will be automatically evaluated on the development test set. You'll see three sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **True Positives**: list of emails and phone numbers that were correctly matched\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **False Positives**: list of emails and phone numbers that your solution *matched* but which *should not be matched*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **False Negatives**: list of emails and phone numbers that your solution *did not match* but which *should be matched*\n",
    "    \n",
    "   As the starter code will inevitably produce some **False Positives** and **False Negatives**, we suggest you then navigate to the `data/dev/` directory, find the appropriate file (its name is the first part of the tuple) and try to debug your regular expression there. This can be easily done in JupyterLab by pressing `Ctrl+F` and typing in your regular expression starting and ending it with forward slashes, such as `/[a-z]@[a-z].edu/`. Pressing Enter afterwards will highlight the parts of the file that matched your regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Repeat 1. and 2. until the number of **False Positives** and **False Negatives** is as small as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "As this assignment uses the Python regular expressions library (`re`), it would be very wise to consult its [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)."
