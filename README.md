# NLP Excercises

This repository contains various exercises that explore mostly Natural
Language Processing (NLP) topics, with focus on their practical usability.


They are implemented as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and we
strongly encourage you to try them out in [Jupyter
Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Probably the easiest way of
getting Jupyter Lab and all the other dependecies is by installing 
[Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
