# NLP Exercises

This repository contains various exercises that explore mostly Natural
Language Processing (NLP) topics, with focus on their practical usability.

They are implemented as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and we
strongly encourage you to try them out in [Jupyter
Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Probably the easiest way of
getting Jupyter Lab and all the other dependecies is by installing
[Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

**Note**: the Jupyter notebooks in this repository expect you to use Python 3.

Here is a quick list of currently available exercises:

- [Exercise 1: Regular Expressions](./ex1-regex)
- [Exercise 2: Edit Distance](./ex2-eddist)
- [Tutorial 1: Language Modeling with Recurrent Neural Networks](./tutorial1-lm)
