        "Note that we are still talking about bag of words model and thus only the presence of a respective ngram matters. Still, thanks to this nice setup we are pretty much by default able to model prefixes and suffixes. That is of huge practical value, since even if we now encountered say the word `bananoid`  which was not present in training data, thanks to the aforementioned character ngrams we are able to assign it at least some representation, rather than calling it an unknown word and replacing its occurences with `UNK`, which is what the standard approach would be.\n",

        "2. Try to see if some pre-processing (lowercasing, removing stop words, punctuation, ...) would be helpful here (the `bananoid` example does really suggest so). Note that fastText splits tokens on whitespace it finds in the input data, so it is not uncommon to find out that it learned word vectors for words like `banana?` among others. If you are looking for an industry-grade tokenizer, take a look at [BlingFire](https://github.com/Microsoft/BlingFire). \n",
        "3. See if you can use some of the same ideas on a different [Amazon Sentiment Analysis dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/amazonreviews/train.ft.txt.bz2) and get the testing precision/recall over 0.9! Note that since you'll only have two classes, looking at $P@3$ and $R@3$ does not make too much sense. Thus, it would be advisable to use the following command to test your model on the validation split: `!./fasttext test-label model.bin ./data.valid`. It will (among other things) print out the metrics per each class, which is very useful in binary classification.\n",
